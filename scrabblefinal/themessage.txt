The image object is going to have a ht/wid. Since it is a square board ht = wd. the ht = wid = TOTAL_PIXEL_EXTENT. The subdivision length is is TOTAL_PIXEL_EXTENT/NUM_SUBDIVISIONS. When I click on the canvas, first use the entire image object as a bounding box. This is an aabb so hella trivial: (x > = xmax && x <= xmin) && (y >= ymax || <= ymin). Now we utilize integer division (being careful since js is weakly typed and cannot be counted upon to discard the mantissa: the number of sibdivisionlengths that go into the x pos clicked upon (dropping, once again, the mantissa) will give the x indice in "checkerboard space". I am not sure that this is the best way to do this but it is nice and does not require measuring the actual graphic.
